Per default the application uses Mojarra 2.2.x running in Jetty w/ Apache OpenWebBeans. 
You can also use other JSF implementation versions with the available maven profiles: myfaces22, myfaces23, mojarra23

`mvn clean jetty:run -Pjetty-owb,myfaces22`

`mvn clean jetty:run -Pjetty-owb,myfaces23`

`mvn clean jetty:run -Pjetty-owb,mojarra22`

`mvn clean jetty:run -Pjetty-owb,mojarra23`

A maven profile also exists which allows the test application to be run in Payara5 with its own embedded Mojarra
